# Admissions
Admissions are offered in M.Tech and PhD programs by Geoinformatics Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering. For information regarding bachelor programs, please [click here](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ce/b-tech-program-in-civil-engineering).

## M.Tech Admission

Admissions are offered once a year (for the semester starting in the month of July in that year). Candidates are selected on the basis of GATE score and called in the month of April for written test and/or interview in the month of May. Some of these candidates, with exceptional performance in their qualifying degree, may be offered direct admission in the month of April. Admissions based on written test and/or interview are offered after about two weeks of test/interview.

## Eligibility Requirements for M.Tech Programme

The applicant must have a bachelor's degree in engineering or a master's degree in science with marks/CPI not below 55% marks (or Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) of 5.5 on a 10-point scale) or the minimum pass marks (or CPI) whichever is greater. Candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes who have a bachelor's degree in engineering or a master's degree in science are eligible to apply irrespective of the marks/CPI.

B.Tech./B.E. degree in Civil/Mining/Electrical/Computer Science/Electronics Engineering/Information Technology/Geoinformatics, or M.Sc. degree in Earth Science streams/Geography/Physics/Mathematics/Environmental Sciences. Candidates with M.Sc. degree must have mathematics as one of the subjects at B.Sc. level.<br>
Notes:
*	In addition to the above, a valid GATE score is needed.
*	The GATE requirement is waived for the B.Tech. graduates from IITs with a minimum overall CPI of 6.5 and a minimum CPI of 8.0 in the last two semesters in B.Tech.  However, such students are not entitled to Institute Assistantship if overall CPI is below 8.0.
*	Candidates with AMIE certificates are not eligible to apply.

## Eligibility Requirements for Ph.D Programme

The applicant must have a master's degree in engineering with marks/CPI not below 55% marks (or CPI of 5.5 on a 10-point scale) or the minimum pass marks (or CPI) whichever is greater. Candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes who have a master's degree in engineering are eligible to apply irrespective of the marks/CPI. Candidates with a bachelor's degree in engineering with marks/CPI not below 75% marks (or CPI of 7.5 on a 10-point scale), or a master's degree in science or an allied area, satisfying each of the following criteria may be considered for admission into the Ph.D. programme:

*	A minimum of 65 percent marks/6.5 CPI in the master's degree
*	First division in  bachelor's degree
*	JRF/95 percentile or higher in GATE. However, a valid GATE score is needed for the candidates with a bachelor's degree in engineering, if they have not graduated from a CFTI (centrally funded technical institute).
*	M.Tech./M.E. degree in Civil/Mining/Electrical/Computer Science/Electronics Engineering/Information Technology, or M.Tech./M.Sc. degree in Earth Science streams/Geography/Physics/Mathematics/Environmental Sciences. Candidates with M.Sc. degree must have mathematics as one of the subjects at B.Sc. level.
