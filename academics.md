# Admissions
Admissions are offered in M.Tech and PhD programs by Geoinformatics Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering. For information regarding the bachelor program, please [click here](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ce/b-tech-program-in-civil-engineering) and for details about the dual degree program, please [click here](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ce/dual-degree-programme-admissions). Announcements regarding the PG programs in the Department of Civil Engineering can be found [here](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ce/pg-admissions).

## M.Tech Admission

Admissions are offered once a year (for the semester starting in the month of July in that year). Candidates are selected on the basis of GATE score and called in the month of April for written test and/or interview in the month of May. Some of these candidates, with exceptional performance in their qualifying degree, may be offered direct admission in the month of April. Admissions based on written test and/or interview are offered after about two weeks of test/interview.

## Eligibility Requirements for M.Tech Programme and Ph.D Programme.
